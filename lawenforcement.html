        <h1>Lords of Waterdeep</h1>
        <h3>History of Waterdavian Government</h3>
        <p class="w3-text-grey">People have inhabited the plateau upon which Waterdeep stands for longer than histories record. But as is the way across the dangerous North, civilization at the foot of Mount Waterdeep has crested and ebbed in great waves. Elf scholars assure me that it was once the site of the capital of their ancient empire. So it was already a glorious place when dwarven prospectors discovered mithral beneath the mountain. Years of turmoil between warring Elvish factions, while the dwarfs tunneled ever deeper, never to be heard from again, left the area empty and suitable for the human tribes that would come to inhabit the area. More warlords came and went as the harbour grew. That is, until a great wizard named Ahghairon defeated the then Warlord of Waterdeep in order to stop his conquest of the North. Ahghairon then gathered the leaders of Waterdeep's armies and powerful families and decreed how the city would be governed. While he would sit as lord openly, a council of other lords of nearly equal power would rule with him. But the identity of those other lords would be hidden even from each other, thus preventing any of them from being approached and influenced by bribe or threat. </p>
        <br>
        <h3>The Open Lord</h3>
        <p class="w3-text-grey">Lady Laeral Silverhand is the current Open Lord of Waterdeep.</p>

      <div class="w3-twothird">
        <h5 class="w3-padding-32">The God Catcher</h5>

        <p class="w3-text-grey">This is perhaps the most famous walking statue in the city, thanks to its dramatic pose, its nearness to the Market, and the self-evident magic of its existence. The statue is of a well-muscled but impassive male human with its left leg sunk to the hip in the street, the result of a spell cast by the Blackstaff at the time of its rampage. Its left hand and right foot press against the ground as if it is trying to pull itself out. Its right arm is raised sky ward, and above its open palm floats a sphere of stone. Its gaze looks up toward the sphere, and the pattern of bird droppings around its eyes gives it the appearance of weeping.</p>
          <p class="w3-text-grey">All about the statue, climbing up its chest and on its knee and shoulders, is a tenement that carries the name "the God Catcher." The tenement's landlord is Aundra Blackcloak, an unsociable sorcerer who is rarely seen in the city except when she alights from the door carved in the floating sphere, which serves as her home. On the rare occasions when she wants to meet with city folk (typically to purchase odd substances for magical purposes), she appears unannounced on balconies or rooftops after dark. Her dealings are polite, though, and she pays fair coin. She never confides in anyone or talks about her own doings-and if anyone but she has ever seen the inside of her spherical home, they've said nothing publicly about it. </p>

      <div class="w3-twothird">
        <h5 class="w3-padding-32">The Griffon</h5>

        <p class="w3-text-grey">The walking statue called the Griffon is shaped like the beast for which it is named. Though it stands on all four legs, its back is fully twenty feet off the ground, making it a mount fit for a storm giant. Although it has shown itself to be capable of flight, with the granite feathers of its wings spreading like a bird's, the Griffon now merely stands in a regal pose near Peaktop Aerie atop Mount
          Waterdeep, looking to the southeast over the Dock Ward. Newcomers sometimes assume it to be a monument to Waterdeep's Griffon Cavalry, but Waterdavians know better.</p>
