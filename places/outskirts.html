        <h1>City Outskirts</h1>
        <h5 class="w3-padding-32">Field Ward</h5>
        <p class="w3-text-grey">This district was once a caravan yard between Waterdeep's two northernmost walls, kept free of settlement to serve as a killing field in times of war. As refugees from various calamities settled there after not being allowed into the city's wealthy northern neighborhoods, the area has grown up into a lawless town of its own. </p>
        <p class="w3-text-grey">Though not an official ward of the city, the Field Ward is commonly referred to as one. The Watch doesn't patrol this area, however, and many crimes go uninvestigated. Guards oversee the Field Ward from the walls around it, but only get involved when folk moving into or out of the city are threatened. </p>
        <p class="w3-text-grey">The area is a muddy mess, populated by the poorest people and those who take advantage of those folks' desperation. It has no sewer system and isn't served by the Dungsweepers' Guild-a fact that will be quite evident to your nose if you venture here. I don't recommend that you spend any more time here than it takes to pass through from one gate to the next.</p>
        <p class="w3-text-grey">The Guild of Butchers operates several slaughterhouses, smokehouses, and leather-making facilities in the area-noisome operations that have been pushed out of the city proper. A word to the wise: being friendly with a burly fellow who is good with a knife is one of your best defenses in the Field Ward. The other place you might solicit aid is Endshift Tavern, a popular stop for off-duty members of the City Guard, situated on the corner of Endshift Street and the Breezeway. Though the guards might not be inclined to assist you, your status as a visitor or citizen of Waterdeep technically obliges them to help you reach the city proper in safety. </p>

        <h5 class="w3-padding-32">Undercliff</h5>

        <p class="w3-text-grey">This area of rolling grassland and small wooded areas east of the city is a rural community focused on farming and animal husbandry, and which caters to travelers. It is also the site of a large and well-protected training camp for the City Watch, and a prison farm (called Amendsfarm) where those convicted of minor offenses work off their debt to the city. Many gnomes and halflings live in this region, and most buildings are built to reflect their stature. </p>
          <p class="w3-text-grey">If you visit this area, I recommend the Snobeedle Orchard and Meadery, owned and run by the Snobeedle halflings. They have a delightful drinking hall and a shop sized for larger patrons, and you can pick your own fruit when it is in season.</p>

        <h5 class="w3-padding-32">Undermountain</h5>

        <p class="w3-text-grey">Tales of this legendary dungeon below Waterdeep are told well by many in the city, but I'll provide you with the basic truths here.</p>
          <p class="w3-text-grey">Beneath the plateau of Waterdeep lies the largest and deepest dungeon in the world. It sprawls out under the city, said to plunge as many as twenty levels deep. The Melairkyn dwarves first excavated the tunnels that would become Undermountain, and the drow are said to have dug their own tunnels up from below. All were claimed, altered, and expanded by the mad wizard Halaster and his apprentices-who are believed to dwell in the dungeons to this day. What drove them deep into the earth remains a mystery, but Undermountain's allure is a siren song that still draws many. If you want to see adventurers descend into the depths, or perhaps glimpse some returning with wondrous treasures, visit the Yawning Portal in the Castle Ward. </p>
